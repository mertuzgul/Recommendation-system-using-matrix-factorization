# Recommendation-system-using-matrix-factorization
Hello there

This project is my graduation project.

You can check my medium share where I wrote a short article about the project.



In summary, in this project, I developed a recommendation system using the matrix factorization method, I tried to reduce the error rate as much as possible by using the root mean squarred error formula, which is widely used in mathematics and is used to determine the success of a recommendation system according to my article research. Using the stochastic gradient descent and typical gradient descent used to reduce the error rate and comparing results.

If anyone wants to examine in more detail, I add the codes of the project, my presentation and project report here.
