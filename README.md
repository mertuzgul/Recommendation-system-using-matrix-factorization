# Recommendation-system-using-matrix-factorization
Hello there,

This project is my graduation project.

You can check my medium post where i wrote a short article about the project.

In summary, in this project, I developed a recommendation system using the matrix factorization method, I tried to reduce the error rate as much as possible by using the root mean squarred error formula, which is widely used in mathematics and is used to determine the success of a recommendation system according to my article research. RMSE is decreased using optimization algorithm. These algorithms are stochastic gradient descent and typical(normal) gradient descent. Data sets trained using these two optimization algorithms. Lastly results of these two algoritm were compared.  

If anyone wants to examine in more detail, I add the codes of the project, my jury presentation and project report here.
